# Organization Module

Creates an AWS organization and SNS topic for billing alarms. 
By default this module also attaches an SCP to the root of the organization that prevents use of root accounts and modification of the `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` role.

## Examples

Minimal configuration: 

```terraform
module "organization" {
  source  = "george-richardson/personal-org/aws//modules/organization"
  version = ">= 1.0.0"
}
```

Add an email subscription to the billing alarms SNS topic: 
```terraform
module "organization" {
  source  = "george-richardson/personal-org/aws//modules/organization"
  version = ">= 1.0.0"

  billing_alarms_email_subscribers = ["george@example.org"]
}
```
