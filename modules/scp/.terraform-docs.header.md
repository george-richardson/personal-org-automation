# SCP Module

Templates an SCP with useful configurable statements. If no configuration is provided, this module will deploy nothing.

## Examples

An SCP that only allows use of the IAM, STS and EC2 services in the Ireland region.

```terraform
module "scp" {
  source  = "george-richardson/personal-org/aws//modules/scp"
  version = ">= 1.0.0"

  allow_services = ["iam", "sts", "ec2"]
  allow_regions  = ["eu-west-1]
}
```

### Adding your own SCP statements

Service Control Policies are an extremely powerful tool, however they are limited to a maximum of 5 attached to any one AWS Organization resource. If you find yourself hitting this limit you can add your own statements to the SCPs generated for any of the modules using the `override_policy_documents` variable.

For example:

```terraform
# Custom policy to deny creating users in IAM
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "custom_scp" {
  statement {
    sid       = "DenyCreateUser"
    effect    = "Deny"
    actions   = ["iam:CreateUser"]
    resources = ["*"]
  }
}

module "scp" {
  source  = "george-richardson/personal-org/aws//modules/scp"
  version = ">= 1.0.0"

  allow_services = ["iam", "sts", "ec2"]
  allow_regions  = ["eu-west-1]

  # Merge custom policy with generated policy from module.
  override_policy_documents = [data.aws_iam_policy_document.custom_scp.json]
}
```
